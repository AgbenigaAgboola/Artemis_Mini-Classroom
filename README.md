# Artemis_Mini-Classroom
Artemis Mini classroom is a platform that seeks to connect teachers and students from various part of the world. We immerse students in a dynamic learning environment where classes are taught with an intention to help students reach their goals and pursue their dream. We believe we can improve the lives of others through learning!


The app was built to be very easy for both teachers and students navigate through and  use. With the use of a simple form classes are added to the platform and teachers can add items to the classes added and this is accessible by the students.


The major point of entry to the app by both sets of users is the dashboard. From their dashboard teachers can add classes to the platform, view their recently added classes and the number of students enrolled to each class.
From the student dashboard, students can see all the classes they are enrolled on,  access all the classes available on the platform see a brief description and then enroll to a class to access full class content.
